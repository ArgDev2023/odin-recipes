    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (10 ounces by weight)</li>
        <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
<h2> Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F</li>
<li>In a food processor, pulse the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar a couple times to combine.</li>
<li>Add the butter and pulse 7-10 times until the butter is completely distributed. You shouldn’t see any chunks of butter, and the mixture should have a sandy texture to it. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk to combine the milk and egg. Save 2 tbsp of it for the egg wash later, and pour the rest into the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Stir to combine with a spatula, until a rough dough forms.</li>
<li>Transfer to a lightly floured countertop and knead about 10 times until the dough comes together into a relatively smooth ball. Take care not to knead too much, or the dough will be tougher and not rise as high.</li>
<li>Roll the dough about an inch thick and use a 2.5″ cutter to cut about 7 circles. Re-roll the scraps and cut out another 2.</li>
<li>Place the scones onto a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet and brush the tops with the reserved egg wash.</li>
<li>Bake the scones for 13-15 minutes, until about tripled in height, and golden brown on the tops and bottoms. Enjoy!</li>
